			<h1>Mushroom Chicken</h1>
			<p>We simply found this recipe while browsing Youtube. It looked so delicious and seemed simple enough. Luckily, we
			   we were correct on both points. This is probably one of the first dishes I can say I was personally very proud of as 
			   it came very close to not having any issues. This was definately a confidence booster. I did feel however that I didn't move fast 
			   enough when it came to moving from one step to the next as was suggested. However, the end result was still very good. After, I had
			   ingredients left over and I made a second batch of mushroom sauce, but with brocolli and cauliflower in it and had it over a steak. It was
			   amazing! Here is a link to the recipe:
