			<h1>Bake Chicken</h1>
			<p>One of the first dishes we had to put on our menu. The classic baked chicken, a common staple.  We that
			since this was such a basic staple we should give ahead and give it an early try.  We asked mom for recipe and she gave 
			us a quick explanation over whatsapp and we followed those. Pictures of whatsapp messages below. Also, there is a link to
			the proper recipe page here:
			<a href = "../../pages/recipes/bakechknrecipe.html"><p id = "link">Bake Chicken Recipe</p></a>
			</p>
			
			<p>First issue we ran into was a dull knife to cut the chicken. We needed to add a new knife and knife sharpening tools to
			   our toolset. Next we needed a second cutting board, so that we could work together.  The tum also took a while as I had to use a
			   manual grinder, a food processor is something we would like to get down the line. I think it came out well and it didn't break which was good.
			   The olive oil made the color a little darker than the vegetable oil would have it but it is much healthier.
			</p>
			
			<p>We browned the chicken and put to bake, pouring in the chicken broth but I think we put too much or we should have waited till after we baked. This is something
			   we would need to clarify with mom as we think it was a little too watery at the end. Overall, it came out delicious though and we enjoyed it very much.
