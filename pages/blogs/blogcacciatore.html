			<h1>Chicken Cacciatore</h1>
			<p>The valentine special. We chose this dish to do for valentines day. We knew we wanted something tomatoe
			   based with olives. We loved the aroma of this dish and we feel it matched the occassion. It was relatively simple
			   and we believe it came out really well over all. The leftovers were even better the second time around. Here is a link
			   to the recipe page:

			<p>At first the sauce seemed to have been too much, but it turned out to be just the right amount. We noticed that many
			   chicken dishes took this first step of browning the chicken before baking. We also had heard about brining the chicken.
			   We will have to add that step to the recipes section!
