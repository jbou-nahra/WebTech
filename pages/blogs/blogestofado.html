			<h1>Chicken Estofado</h1>
			<p>This one was actually done by the great mama bear herself, I tagged along as sous-chef to help and learn. This
			   is an olive and caper heavy dish and really forms the basis of the flavor, which is awesome as I looooove olives!
			   Again wasn't that hard after all, or is that I am just getting more comfortable in the kitchen!? We had this meal for dinner as well.
			   It was great to have mom back in town, we laughed and had a good time. The link for the recipe is here:
