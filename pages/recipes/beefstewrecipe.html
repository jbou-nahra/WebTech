							<h1>Beef Stew</h1>
							
							<ol>
								<li>Heat half of the oil in a large pan over high heat. Sear the beef in batches for 5 minutes or until browned; transfer each batch to a large heatproof bowl or plate. 
								</li>
								<li>Add the remaining oil to the pan, add onion and shallot and cook for 4 minutes, stirring regularly. Add in the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
   								    Add ground cumin and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. Add red wine, red wine vinegar and the chicken stock. Mix to combine and bring to a simmer. 
								</li>	
								<li>Add the beef back in with the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves and bay leaves; boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, place on a lid and cook for 1 hour.
								</li>	
								<li>Remove the lid; add the oregano and currants (optional) and cook, uncovered, over low heat, for another 1 hour or until meat is tender and sauce has reduced. Season to taste.
								</li>
								<li> Repeat the process of basting the chicken one more time and place the chicken back into the oven for a final 10 minutes. The total cooking time is 40 minutes to achieve a 
								     nice caramelisation and colour. Remove and let rest for 10 minutes. 
								</li>
								<li>Serve the wings in bowls or eat them straight off the tray. Garnish with sesame seeds, spring onion (scallion), and chilli. Dig in. 
								</li>
							</ol>
