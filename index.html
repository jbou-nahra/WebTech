			<p>		Hi, all! Welcome to our food site, Kinder Cookery. A web extension of our kitchen. We are relatively beginner cooks looking to up our game in the kitchen and we
			   would love to share our journey with you! We will be attempting many different dishes over the course of the coming months and will
			   write about our progress and lessons while sharing photos and stories with you through this website.  We will also be keeping a repository 
			   of recipes that we have tried. We will also record different versions of recipes as we will probably do the same dishes more than once and
			   will try different things the next time around. Feel free to browse around and have fun.
			</p>
			
			<p>The website is pretty straight forward. Recipe page has all the recipes listed and can be searched and the blog page has all the blogs listed from latest to oldest.
